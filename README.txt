This was basically part of my test python:

A file contains a sequence of integers, stored one per line. Implement a class that facilitates iteration over these integers.
A valid integer is a sequence of one or more digits (without leading zeros), optionally preceded by a plus or minus sign, representing a number within
the range [−1,000,000,000..1,000,000,000]. We allow spaces to appear in a line before and/or after a valid integer. Lines are separated with the linefeed
character (ASCII code 10).
De􀂦ne a generator function solution returning an iterator that iterates over integers from a 􀂦le object compliant with the above format.
Assumptions:
-the file can contain only line-feed characters (ASCII code 10) and printable ASCII characters (ASCII codes from 32 to 126);
-for every file your iterator will be used only once.
